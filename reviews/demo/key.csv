Heuristic evaluation of user interfaces,https://doi.org/10.1145/97243.97281,CHI,1990,Jukob Nielsen and Rolf Molich,"Heuristic evaluation is an informal method of usability analysis where a number of evaluators are presented with an interface design and asked to comment on it. Four experiments showed that individual evaluators were mostly quite bad at doing such heuristic evaluations and that they only found between 20 and 51% of the usability problems in the interfaces they evaluated. On the other hand, we could aggregate the evaluations from several evaluators to a single evaluation and such aggregates do rather well, even when they consist of only three to five people.","The labelling task will certainly require redundancy and supervision. Presents the opportunity to create a human-in-the-loop evaluation tool, at a much lower complexity than an interactive UI design tool -- at least for now.",2,Legitimizes the potential for learnersourcing in heurisitic evaluation,3,The focus of the project is using heuristics to evaluate UIs,2,"Is associated with design, but does not provide particular suggestions (other than existing Nielson)",1,No relation
AndroZoo: Collecting Millions of Android Apps for the Research Community,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7832927/authors#authors,MSR,2016,"Kevin Allix, Tegawendé F. Bissyandé, Jacques Klein, Yves Le Traon","We present a growing collection of Android Applications col-lected from several sources, including the official GooglePlay app market. Our dataset, AndroZoo, currently contains more than three million apps, each of which has beenanalysed by tens of different AntiVirus products to knowwhich applications are detected as Malware. We provide thisdataset to contribute to ongoing research efforts, as well asto enable new potential research topics on Android Apps.By releasing our dataset to the research community, we alsoaim at encouraging our fellow researchers to engage in reproducible experiments.","Another potential dataset -- doesn't have the metadata or user traces, but is massive and may be useful for expanding test set / writing paper. Widely used, especially before widespread use of RICO",1,No relation,2,"Dataset which could be used to evaluate interfaces, but does not make any claims of evaluation",2,Is a dataset of UI designs,1,No relation
Automatic Graphics Program Generation using Attention-Based Hierarchical Decoder,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.11536.pdf,ACCV,2018,"Zhihao Zhu, Zhan Xue, and Zejian Yuan","Recent progress on deep learning has made it possible to au- tomatically transform the screenshot of Graphic User Interface (GUI) into code by using the encoder-decoder framework. While the commonly adopted image encoder (e.g., CNN network), might be capable of ex- tracting image features to the desired level, interpreting these abstract image features into hundreds of tokens of code puts a particular challenge on the decoding power of the RNN-based code generator. Considering the code used for describing GUI is usually hierarchically structured, we propose a new attention-based hierarchical code generation model, which can describe GUI images in a finer level of details, while also being able to generate hierarchically structured code in consistency with the hierar- chical layout of the graphic elements in the GUI. Our model follows the encoder-decoder framework, all the components of which can be trained jointly in an end-to-end manner. The experimental results show that our method outperforms other current state-of-the-art methods on both a publicly available GUI-code dataset as well as a dataset established by our own.",Screenshot to code in case we want to do a visual-only dataset (or maybe extend to physical interfaces -- not sure how generalizable?)
